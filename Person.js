/*Step 2
Implement the Person class in Person.js. A Person should have these characteristics:
- A property "name" which is a string passed in through the constructor
- A property "health" which is hardcoded to 100 initially
- A property "weapon" which is null initially
- A method equipWeapon(weapon), which will take a weapon object and attach it to the "weapon" property
- A method attack(person), which will deduct health from the target based on what weapon this person has equipped */
//As you build out the Person Class you should notice some familiar elements that youâ€™ll be rendering on the screen once the game is working like name, health, weapon and image.

class Person {
    constructor(name){
        this.name = name;
        this.health = 100;
        this.weapon = null;
    }
    equipWeapon(weapon){
        this.weapon = weapon;
    }
    attack (person){
        person.health = person.health - this.weapon.damage
    }
}
